# Customer-Churn-Analysis-for-a-Telecommunication-Company


## Introduction

### Description 

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. Churn refers to customers who stop using the companyâ€™s services. By identifying factors that influence churn, the company can develop strategies to retain customers, thus increasing revenue and profitability.

### Objective:

- Understand the data and identify key factors that affect customer churn.
- Build and evaluate a classification model to predict churn.
- Provide actionable insights to the company to reduce churn rates.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant difference in the features (demographics, usage patterns, etc.) between customers who churn and those who do not.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a significant difference in the features (demographics, usage patterns, etc.) between customers who churn and those who do not.
